# Roadmap for AI for Medical Imaging

The most wanted contributions to the course are listed here.  
For instructions on how to contribute, please refer to the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/philips-internal/AI-for-Medical-Imaging/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Adding new content
- MR chapter - some materials were already gathered in the [corresponding feature branch](https://github.com/philips-internal/AI-for-Medical-Imaging/tree/features/mri_chapter)
- IGT chapter

## Testing
- Take the course - pass it as a student, do all the tasks, estimate time spent, and provide feedback. The course hasn't been passed completely by anyone yet, so testing it would help a lot.
