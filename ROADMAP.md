# Roadmap for AI for Medical Imaging

Thank you for taking a look at our plans!  
The most wanted contributions to the course are listed here.

For instructions on how to contribute, please refer to the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/philips-labs/AI-for-Medical-Imaging/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Priorities
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Adding an MRI chapter](#adding-new-content) - as it's next of the most popular modalities after what we covered already

## Adding new content
- MRI chapter - some materials were already gathered in the [corresponding feature branch](https://github.com/philips-labs/AI-for-Medical-Imaging/tree/features/mri_chapter)
- fMRI chapter
- IGT chapter
- US chapter
- PET chapter
- Microscopy and Digital Pathology chapter

## Testing
- Take the course - pass it as a student, do all the tasks, estimate time spent, and provide feedback. The course hasn't been passed completely by anyone yet, so testing it would help a lot.  

## Other
- Reviews - if you found a typo, a mistake, or something that is hard to read/understand, please point that out.
We aim to make that course as clean and clear as possible.
