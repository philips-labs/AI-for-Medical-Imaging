### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for AI for Medical Imaging, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing material**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Perform a [search](https://github.com/philips-labs/AI-for-Medical-Imaging/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/philips-labs/AI-for-Medical-Imaging/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **detailed description of the suggested enhancement**.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most AI for Medical Imaging course users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

#### Roadmap
