(WIP) A Pile of thoughts
========================

Data sources:

- X-ray

- CT (+ contrast)

- MRI (+ contrast)

- fMRI

- US

- PET

- Microscopy (?)

For each source:

- How images are obtained (physics behind it, raw data format etc.)

- How the images look like

- How the images are used (medical value)

- How the images are stored (DICOM/NIfTI/???)

- Typical image preprocessing schemes

- How to split the data

- Link to the data to play with
